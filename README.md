# Background-Images

Challenge: Your starting point is two divs: one with the class .animal, the other with the class .animals. The challenge is to set an animal image as the background for both divs.

* For the .animal div, the background image should display once and take up the full width and height of the container.

* For the .animals div, the background image should take up a quarter of the container, and repeat four times: it should have a 2-by-2 grid composed of the same animal image.

* To complete, you'll need to use the following CSS properties: background-image, background-repeat, and background-size.
